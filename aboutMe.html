			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>
				I have pursed my career as a developer since the age of 16, when I graduated from my secondary school to join a technical high school. My major at technical high school was Information Technology after which I attended college at University of Mumbai (India) and majored in Computer Engineering.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am a self-motivated and curious individual who likes solving problems and learning new things everyday. I have a clear understanding of Object Oriented Programming Principles, and that has helped me develop applications with ease. I have an experience with agile development strategy and also with code collaboration & version controlling using Git.
