			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>
				Cloud Computing, Smartphones, Tablets, Social Networking Service and Virtual Reality,
				these are just some of the innumerable and incredibly innovative ideas that the field of computers has offered up in recent times.
				It seems like just when you think that technology cannot get any better,
				another day comes along that brings with it yet another ground-breaking concept that makes the thought that was introduced just the day before seem like ancient history.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having spent the better part of my teenage years following this interminable and rapid technological development taking place in the field of computers,
				I knew early on that I wanted to be a part of this scientific arena that was continuously revolutionizing our lives.
			</p>
			<p>
				And here I am, pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science at the <a class="textLinks" href="http://www.uic.edu">University of Illinois at Chicago!</a>
